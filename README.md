# Interactive Rubiks Cube 

A fun little project that creates a Rubiks cube using Javafx. The Rubiks Cube can be interacted with, shuffled, and solved. 

*Do Note that the program doesn't intelligently slove the rubiks cube. It is just storing the transformations performed on the cube and then repreferforming them in reverse. In future I plan to change this to a uniform cost search with some heuristics to actually 'solve' the cube*

## How to Use

Drag the mouse around the screen to pivot the view of the cube. 

Each face can be Rotated clockwise by pressing the key on the keyboard corrisponding to the color of face. E.g. Pressing b rotates the blue face clockwise. 

for counter clockwise rotations press the key immediately to the right of the clockwise key. E.g. pressing N rotates the blue face counterclowise. 

*Do note that I havent implemented the middle face M rotation yet*

The 'Shuffle' and 'Solve Buttons' can be switched between by pressing the arrow keys. Press Space to execute the button.
